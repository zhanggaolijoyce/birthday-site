I finish this simple project under Scrimba(https://scrimba.com/playlist/pMgPEAM)

It can be used to celebrate other's birthday. It consists of three parts, when the mouse hovers over each gift icon, it will show different pictures.

I practiced my html and css skills through this project. I learned to customize elements on the website through class and id, as well as change this part into a different style when hovering over it. I learned about safe fonts and how to use web fonts. Also, I learned many other details in designing websites like font style, background image, footer style, anchor style and so on...
